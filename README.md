This project focuses on improving communication reliability in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) by leveraging Graph Attention Networks (GATs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

I. Key Objectives
Improve the reliability of communication paths in WSNs and UWSNs.

Predict optimal and stable routing paths using advanced AI models.

Overcome challenges such as node failure, battery depletion, signal loss, and dynamic network topology.

II. Methodology
a. GAT-Based Model for WSNs
Simulates a mesh network of 10â€“12 nodes with dynamic features (battery life, status, reliability, node degree).

Uses Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to weigh the importance of neighboring nodes.

Predicts the most reliable communication paths based on real-time node features.

Outperforms traditional methods like ROBDD, offering shorter and more stable paths.

Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

b. GNN-RL Hybrid Model for UWSNs
Tackles harsher underwater challenges: high latency, signal attenuation, and link failures.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model complex spatial relationships between sensor nodes.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) introduces adaptability, learning optimal routing strategies from environmental feedback.

Combines GNN's structural understanding with RL's decision-making capabilities.

Results in more reliable routing, reduced energy usage, and extended network lifetime.

III. Outcomes
Improved reliability in both WSNs and UWSNs.

Real-time adaptability to changing network conditions.

Higher accuracy and resilience compared to traditional routing algorithms.

Provides a scalable framework for future deployment in real-world applications.
